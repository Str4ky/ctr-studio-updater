# CTR Studio Updater
Lets you update CTR Studio

## Installation:
Download `ctrut.exe` and put it in a folder where it's in the PATH (for example `C:\Windows`)

## Usage:
To use it you need to use Windows's command prompt<br><br>
To set CTR Studio's folder<br>
`ctrut set <ctr studio folder>`<br>
Set the folder where `CTR Studio.exe` is inside<br><br>
To create a shortcut on the desktop or in the start menu to the script's verify function<br>
`ctrut shortcut desktop/startmenu`<br>

`ctrut update`
To either launch Citra or update it if it's not up to date<br>
`ctrut verify`

## ATTENTION!!!
### DO NOT SET THE FOLDER TO ANY FOLDER WITH DATAS YOU DON'T WANT TO LOSE OR YOU WILL LOSE ANY DATAS AFTER UPDATING
Theoretically you cannot as I made it so the program checks if it's a valid CTR Studio folder but don't try to bypass this to put a folder that can erase datas
